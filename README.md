# Optimizing the Optimizer for PINNs

This repository includes the implementation of the **Self-scaled Quasi-Newton algorithms** proposed in:

**Optimizing the Optimizer for Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks**  
DOI: [10.1016/j.cma.2025.118308](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2025.118308)

This project requires the following Python packages and versions:

TensorFlow: 2.10.1

Keras: 2.10.0

NumPy: 1.24.1

SciPy: 1.12.0


Download modified_minimize.py and modified_optimize.py, then overwrite SciPyâ€™s originals located at:

.../site-packages/scipy/optimize/_minimize.py

.../site-packages/scipy/optimize/_optimize.py

You can control which optimizer variant is used by setting the method_bfgs parameter.

This tells the modified SciPy backend which self-scaled algorithm to apply.

For example:

method_bfgs = "SSBFGS_AB"

Other supported options include "SSBroyden", "SSDFP", "SSPSB", and "SSLBFGS".
